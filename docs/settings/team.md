## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

- **Owner**: Only one, typically the business owner
- **Admin**: Office managers, dispatchers, supervisors
- **Member**: Mechanics who need read-only access

### Onboarding New Members

1. Create the invite with appropriate role
2. Copy and share the link directly
3. Explain what Uplio is and how you use it
4. Walk them through key features
5. Set up their notification preferences

### Security

- Revoke access promptly when someone leaves
- Use appropriate roles (don't make everyone Admin)
- Regularly review the member list
- Keep owner credentials secure

### Email Consistency

If someone is both a mechanic and a team member:
- Use the same email for both
- This enables personalized Technician View
- Keeps records connected

---

## Troubleshooting

### Invite Not Received

- Check spam/junk folders
- Verify the email address is correct
- Try revoking and re-creating
- Copy the link manually and send directly

### Can't Accept Invite

- Link may be expired
- Account may already exist with different email
- Try a different browser
- Contact the workspace admin

### Wrong Role Assigned

- Admin can change roles immediately
- No need to remove and re-invite
- Just click the appropriate role button
