## Sample Outreach Email

**Subject:** Are you still using spreadsheets for inspections?

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] services elevators in [City]. I'm reaching out because we just launched Uplio—a modern service management platform built specifically for elevator companies like yours.

Quick question: How are you currently tracking inspection expiration dates across all your buildings?

If it involves spreadsheets or sticky notes, you're not alone. But there's a better way.

Uplio automatically tracks inspection deadlines, alerts you before they expire, and even lets building managers check their units' status through a customer portal.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - We're offering 2 months free for companies that sign up this month.
